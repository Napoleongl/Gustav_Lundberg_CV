\opening{Dear Sir and Madam,}
My name is Gustav and I'm a student at the masters programme "Statistics and Machine Learning" at Linköpings University and I'm very interested in writing my masters theisis at Spotify.

Analytics and machine learning are fields that I have a high interest in, and analytics based decisions have been part of my previous job roles; most notably as a revenue manager with the hospitality industry but also in creating and tailoring reports for hotels in my role as application conslutant. Another key part in the tools I have developed in my work is that they should be accessible and intuitive not only for me as the creator but for other users as well. Understanding what guests and clients are actually looking for, although they may not know exactly how to express it, and how I can assist them in their search is something I take a great pride in doing well. As such I think that the thesis suggestion in Data Science is something I very well suited for, but the Machine Learning suggestions are also subjects where I believe I can contribute!

In my previous work I have mostly used Microsoft Excel with some VBA and SQL to get the job done, while in the masters programme we have gotten versed in R and Python. On top of this I have done a bit of programming in C++. The programme includes courses where machine learning and data mining algorithms are programmed from scratch as well as utilizing libraries like Spark and Tensorflow to do the analysis.

The thesis work will start in January 2020 and I would very much like to contribute to the fantastic work I think Spotify has done in getting the music industry and artists to better reach the listeners in a connected world! 

Some things that may be good to know about the thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item The master thesis is a 30 credits course, spanning over 5 months of intensive work where I will on fulltime dig in to the problem and explain why it could be solved or not.
\item This thesis is a scientific thesis where I will put the work in a scientific context and will be written from a statistical point of view.
\item The thesis is in the end going to be published on the university database (DIVA) which is public. Some data/info can be masked, but not too much.
\item There should be enough data and data that had good enough quality. I am prepared to do some data cleaning, but to a certain extent. Since the master thesis is not about collecting or cleaning data, but a thesis about Statistics or Machine Learning.
\end{itemize}

I hope that you find it interesting to have a student doing a master thesis in Statistics and Machine Learning at Spotify. I am looking forward to discussing a potential topic with you!

Best Regards\\
